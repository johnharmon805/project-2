# Link to my app (MVP only) - [Essy Essentials](https://project-eo2.herokuapp.com/)

## Welcome to Essy Essentials
Essy Essentials is a one stop shop for all your covid-19 essentials. 

Amazon out of hand-sanitizer? We got you covered.
Costco out of toilet paper? We got plenty here.

Covid-19 and all that it's brought with it is already stressful enough. Finding toilet paper shouldn't be.

This is our first full stack application. Our goal was to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that utilized Stripe's API and MySQL.
